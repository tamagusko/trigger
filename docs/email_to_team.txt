Subject: TRIGGER Open edX Platform Ready for Testing

Dear Gabriel and Professor Pilla,

Based on Gabriel's request, I'm pleased to inform you that the TRIGGER online course platform is now ready for testing.

The platform is built on Open edX (the same technology used by MIT and Harvard for edX.org) and provides comprehensive features for creating and delivering online courses, including:

• Course creation and content management (videos, quizzes, assignments)
• Student enrollment and progress tracking
• Discussion forums and peer assessments
• Grading and certification
• Multi-language support
• Mobile-responsive interface

The platform runs on Docker containers, which allows you to:
1. Test and configure it locally on any computer
2. Deploy to any cloud provider (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud)
3. Scale automatically to accommodate any number of users

For deployment in Europe (AWS Ireland region), the estimated annual cost is approximately €2,000-2,500 for a production environment supporting hundreds of concurrent users, with the ability to scale up or down based on demand.

I would be happy to demonstrate the platform, show you how to run it locally, and walk through the testing procedures. The complete documentation, including setup guides and deployment instructions, is available in our GitHub repository: https://github.com/tamagusko/trigger

Please let me know when would be convenient for a demonstration.

Best regards,
Tiago Tamagusko
